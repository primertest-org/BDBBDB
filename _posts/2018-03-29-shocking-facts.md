It's been a long time coming but now is time. Time for me to speak out and to give back. I have worked in the IT industry for more than 38 years and it is time for me to share my knowledge with a select group of clients. Clients that want to grow their business. Clients who are serious about growing their business. Clients who are prepared to commit to improvement and stick to a plan.

I want my clients to laser focus on improving their business each and every day for 365 days.

If you can improve your business by just 1% everyday then by the end of the year 1 becomes 37.8. That is growth by any measure.

If however you were to let things slide by 1% everyday then by the end of the year your business will be only 3% of the business you started with.

Is it possible to improve your business by 1% everyday. Quite possibly. What is clear is that if you do nothing you will go nowhere.
